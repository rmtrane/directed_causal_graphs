# BETS
Causal Network Inference and Analysis from Time Series

BETS is a Python package that infers causal networks from time series data. 

It is described in [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/587170v1) with the analysis available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14f47-XB9KzBKn-BMwwfgb-0hXSFCJC2n?usp=sharing).

# Is BETS right for you?

BETS is a good method for your problem if:
* you have a dataset of gene expression values (or other assay type) over time
  * time points are *about* equally spaced
  * number of genes can greatly exceed number of time points (thousands is fine, if you have a computing cluster)
  * Multiple replicates are allowed if each replicate has the same number of timepoints.
* you want to know about the strength and time delay of the causal effects

# Requirements

BETS is coded in Python 2.7. It requires installation of the following libraries:

* [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html) (>= 1.13.1)
* [scipy](https://scipy.org/install.html) (>= 0.19.1)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html) (>= 0.20.3)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html) (>= 1.4.3)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) (>= 0.0)

It has been tested on MacOSX v.10.11.6.

# About the Method 

BETS is short for "Bootstrap Elastic net regression from Time Series", a statistical framework based on Granger causality for the recovery of a directed gene network from transcriptional time series data. applies regularized vector autoregression along with a permutation-based 
null and False Discovery control to infer causal networks. It was designed
for a high-dimensional gene-expression time series data. 

# Authors

BETS was developed by Jonathan Lu, Bianca Dumitrascu, and Professor Barbara Engelhardt in the [Engelhardt Group](beehive.cs.princeton.edu) at the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University over 2016-2019.
